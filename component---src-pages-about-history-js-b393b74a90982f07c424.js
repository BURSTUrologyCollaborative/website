He had discussions with James Haddow from the LSRG, Aneel Bhangu of the West Midlands Research Collaborative and Angelos Kolias from the British Neurosurgical Trainee Collaborative.

At a similar time, other British urologists including Dan Wood, were involved in developing the acronym BURST, which was given a session at the BAUS annual conference for discussion of research amongst trainees. It was fascinating to understand how the BURST session at the BAUS conference came about and got its name and clearly the desire to carry out research amongst trainees had always been there. Although the BURST session at BAUS was an annual event which trainees became accustomed to attending, in the 2010s there was no formal research collaborative associated with it.

This established the BURST network and led to the formation of a number of national and international collaborations. It has developed into a prize-winning collaborative that has presented work around the world and is having impact on urological research and practice.
