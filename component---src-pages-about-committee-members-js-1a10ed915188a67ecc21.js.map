While working with BURST, I hope to develop my academic writing skills, participate in current research and learn from the successful leaders around me.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI have experience with research, having written two systematic literature reviews, one of which was awarded the BAUS medical student prize for the University. However, I aim to develop my skills further by engaging in different types of studies, such as DETORT. I look forward to contributing towards the education aspect of this study, as I have experience in teaching.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOutside of my degree, I enjoy playing piano and supporting my local football team with my father.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"tile is-parent\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"tile is-child box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"columns is-mobile is-centered is-vcentered\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"column is-one-third\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span className=\"title is-size-4 is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t <strong> </strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span className=\"subtitle is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t <strong></strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<hr></hr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1 className=\"is-size-6 is-size-6-mobile\" >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"tile is-parent\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"tile is-child box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"columns is-mobile is-centered is-vcentered\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"column is-one-third\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span className=\"title is-size-4 is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t <strong> </strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span className=\"subtitle is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t <strong></strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<hr></hr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1 className=\"is-size-6 is-size-6-mobile\" >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br></br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t\t<Footer />\n\t</div>\n);\n\nexport default CommitteeMembersPage;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/arjun-c3b84d6502b01054ed661baa89699e06.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/wendy-f27b1900e8340b8c994d55eb76a0d5ff.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/alexng-2ee38dd8fcf4a6730efad73463163080.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/taimur-d4f14d2d1bc9d6b288f029cff5c68c61.jpg\";","import React from 'react';\nimport GroupPic from '../images/img/group-pic.jpg';\n\nimport './style.scss';\n\nimport gatsbyLogo from '../images/gatsby-icon.png';\n\nimport Navbar from './navbar';\n\nconst HeaderTwo = () => (\n<html>\n\t\t<Navbar />\n <div class=\"card\">\n \t\t<div class=\"card-image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"image is-2by1\">\n\t\t\t  \t\t<img src={GroupPic}></img>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</html>\n);\n\nexport default HeaderTwo;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/stefani-7e80cf90ca58f7235760b6b0d286bf13.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/veeru-652acbc129cd50675eac5fd64ba493e1.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/nikita-4d22cd0e876e3264f19c4ffbe59c7c4b.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/meg-7547fa8499829b52ef45f8702013d888.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/aishah-0550f9e8d135f585e4ad1fa6b3253ffe.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/aqua-07163f42792432195b664e3d9a490f95.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/kenneth-58d36c0bf304a9513a812f49a2e671ab.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/eleanor-445dc70fab645dd29bba8605cbd99cb5.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/gallagher-b46c758caa9631dadd3458f37306408d.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/semhar-54745058324cba96c05cc367de8c5692.jpeg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/SR-fdba94c0a9fa0b01e7ff3e95bd461700.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/gatsby-icon-4a9773549091c227cd2eb82ccd9c5e3a.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/sinan-340c7d98596bb5e25e2746fec9037283.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hannah-d9e8f4eacccc2afd3d11899e0c0312f2.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/kevinb-40e5737db82c77cbbfc72b5e16720b83.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
