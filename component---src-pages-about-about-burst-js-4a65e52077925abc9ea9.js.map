Sometimes termed cohort studies. Sometimes this data can be obtained from audit. The advantage of these types of studies is that ethical approval and funding may not always be required. To produce higher levels of evidence, interventional studies (e.g. randomized controlled trials) are important but observational studies still have an important role, particularly in generating hypotheses.\n                </h2>\n                <h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n                <strong>Interventional studies</strong> – if randomising patients to one arm or another, ensure that the majority of clinicians have <strong>“equipoise”</strong>. I.e. that at each centre, the lead clinician has genuine uncertainty over whether the interventions under investigation are better than one another and that they would be happy to randomise patients to either of the interventions. If many clinicians have strong preferences for one intervention or another, the study will not recruit well.\n                </h2>\n                <h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n                For interventional studies – the <strong>simpler the intervention </strong>and the easier it will be to administer as part of clinical practice, the more likely the study will be successful.
