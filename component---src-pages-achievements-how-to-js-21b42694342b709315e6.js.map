Steering committee </strong>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\tA member of the steering committee is involved in the conception, development, administration and delivery of a study. They will typically be involved in study design, development of tools, preparation of the protocol, and dissemination plan. They will have in depth understanding of governance and research principles behind the study. The steering group will have critically appraised the literature in order to understand ap- propriate study methods and relevant data points.\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\t<strong>2. Writing group </strong>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\tThe writing group is responsible for reviewing existing evidence, assessing and/or analysing data from the project, and preparing a manuscript for publication. In order to do so, they will have critically appraised the literature and synthesised knowledge in context of project findings.\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\t<strong>3. Regional lead </strong>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\tNot all studies will require a regional lead and it is likely to be an ‘optional’ role depending onthe structure of the study. Large multi-centre national studies often require individuals at a regional level to coordinate centres in that region to take part in the study. The regional lead is involved in the recruitment and support of participating sites. They share information between regions and the steering group. These individuals need to have an understanding of the research governance processes in order to open the study at local sites. The regional leads will be circulated summaries of analyses, and be required to approve a final manuscript for submission ahead of peer-review.\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\t<strong>4. Local lead </strong>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\tThe local lead is responsible for hospital or trust level co-ordination. They identify and confirm the names of local collaborators and support the named local clinician (where applicable). They should ensure that an appropriate number of local collaborators are involved and listed accordingly in any documentation. A key role of the local lead is to ensurelocal clinical governance approvals are obtained and adhered to. They should also ensure that the findings of the study are presented locally, or have a date arranged for local presentation, as part of audit sign-off. They are usually involved in collecting data for the project. Similarly, the local leads will be circulated summaries of analyses, and be required toapprove a final manuscript for submission ahead of peer-review.\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\t<strong>5. Local collaborator </strong>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\tLocal collaborators are responsible for the collection and return of data during the study. Each site may have more than one local collaborator. As well as trainees, a local consultant providing oversight to the group may be listed as a local collaborator. The collaborator will befamiliar with the study protocol and operate within local governance frameworks and approvals. Depending on the nature of the study, eligible patient numbers may vary. It is important that this is recognised by each steering group and targets adjusted accordingly. A final manuscript is circulated and reviewed by local collaborators ahead of peer-review.\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\t<strong>6. Data validator</strong>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\tA data validator is typically involved in confirming case ascertainment and establishing data accuracy. This should ideally be someone who is independent from the data collection phase. The validator will be familiar with the study protocol and operate within local governance frameworks and approvals. Depending on the nature of the study, eligible patient numbers may vary. It is important that this is recognised by each steering group and targets adjusted accordingly. Similarly, a final manuscript is circulated and reviewed by local collaborators ahead of peer-review.\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\t<strong>7. Data analysis group </strong>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\tThis is someone who may be involved in formulating the statistical analysis plan and/or usesthe data produced in a study to summarise results, carry out statistical tests and draw conclusions, ready for presentation or publication.\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\t<strong>8. Advisory group </strong>\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t<h2 className=\"subtitle is-size-5-mobile\">\n\t\t\tThis is someone who provides expert advice on the design and feasibility of a collaborative project. This includes pre-publication peer review, expert advice and guidance.\n\t\t\t</h2>\n\n\n        </div>\n        </section>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t<Footer />\n\t</div>\n);\n\nexport default HowToPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
