The dream was always to work in the NHS until I got severely ill from a campylobacter infection due to cooked chicken at 21. My bowel and bladder began to fail and would not empty like they used to. I eventually got a diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy and bowel and bladder dysfunction and failure due to the campylobacter. At 24, I was 7 stone and severely malnutrition unable to empty my bowel so an ileostomy was formed. Regarding my bladder, I had to do ISC, have a urethral catheter placed then an SPC which I had for 7 years. Then at the age of 28 after a routine cystoscopy the results revealed the bladder was extremely damaged and the cells had started to mutate. My consultants were concerned and decided to do a cystectomy and form an ileal conduit (urostomy).
